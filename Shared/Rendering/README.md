# Summary

The 'Shared\Rendering' library is a collection of simple renderers that can be used when visualizing computation results on HoloLens. The SlateRenderer is used by many of the samples to show the camera preview. You will also find code to draw simple markers and polylines.

The starting point for the slate material and the renderers is the cube rendering code from "Holographic DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows)" template that you can obtain by installing the [HoloLens Emulator and Holographic Templates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools).
