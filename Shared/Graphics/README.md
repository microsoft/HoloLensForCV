# Summary

The 'Shared\Graphics' library contains code to manage graphics device and holographic cameras.

Similarly to 'Shared\Holographic', the starting point for this library is the code from "Holographic DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows)" template that you can obtain by installing the [HoloLens Emulator and Holographic Templates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools).
