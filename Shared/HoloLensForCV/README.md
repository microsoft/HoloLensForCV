# Summary

The 'Shared\HoloLensForCV' Universal Windows Platform (or, UWP) component provides an easy interface to enumerate HoloLens sensors and to allow apps easy access the sensor streams.

The component also includes both client and server code to enable streaming sensor data to a companion PC, as well as a recorder functionality that produces a tarball with the camera images and sensor metadata that can be used for offline/batch processing.
