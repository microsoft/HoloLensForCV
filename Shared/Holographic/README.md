# Summary

The 'Shared\Holographic' library contains some of the application glue code common to our samples and tools. The goal here was to thin down the samples and tools to make it easier to focus on the computer vision related code.

Similarly to 'Shared\Graphic', the starting point for this library is the code from "Holographic DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows)" template that you can obtain by installing the [HoloLens Emulator and Holographic Templates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools).

Note that we have opted to preserve the TODO comments from the app template.
