# Summary

The 'Tools\Recorder' project is an app that makes use of HoloLensForCV
component's API to record all sensor streams and their corresponding poses into
tar archives on the internal HoloLens storage.

Once the application is deployed and launched on the HoloLens, follow the voice
UI prompts to start and stop recording.

The tarballs containing the recordings can be downloaded from the HoloLens using
the Samples/py/recorder_console.py script or the Device Portal's file explorer.
