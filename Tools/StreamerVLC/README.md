# Summary

The 'Tools\Streamer' project is an app that makes use of HoloLensForCV component's streaming
functionality. This sample is specialized for streaming the visible light camera (VLC) images.

When the application is launched, a preview window will be displayed showing the selected camera
view (air-tap to reposition the preview slate).

Use the Receiver tool to connect to the streamer, or take a look at the ComputeOnDesktop sample
app -- both will connect to the streamer app using the HoloLensForCV component and allow for sensor
data processing on a companion PC.
